Last but not least!
After installing the application with npm, there are some final steps one must follow
in order to ensure that it runs properly. The SimpleUploadAdapter has to be included in
the ckeditor (ClassicEditor), and to include it you should do this:

git clone -b stable https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5
cd ckeditor5/packages/ckeditor5-build-classic
npm install
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload

then  add the following lines in /src/ckeditor.js : 

import SimpleUploadAdapter from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/src/adapters/simpleuploadadapter';
 (right below the importations)

SimpleUploadAdapter
(in ClassicEditor.builtinPlugins, right below TextTransformation. Don't forget the coma!)

Then:

yarn run build

and then copy and paste the package.json and the build folder
to frontend/blogservice/node_modules/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic . Replace every file needed. 

Further instructions on ckeditor and the simpleUploadAdapter may be found in the following links: 
https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/installing-plugins.html
https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/image-upload/simple-upload-adapter.html#configuration


It is strongly recommended that you run
npx patch-package ckeditor5-build-classic
afterwards, otherwise the original form of
ckeditor5-build-classic  will be coming back with each and every npm update.
